2. Permissions page runtime error
3. Settings API endpoints

### Important (Phase 2)
1. File attachments (S3 integration)
2. Bulk operations
3. Export functionality
4. Time tracking

### Nice to Have (Phase 3)
1. AI Knowledge Base search
2. Epic/Sub-task hierarchy
3. Advanced analytics

## PERFORMANCE METRICS

- **Page Load Times**: < 2 seconds
- **API Response Times**: < 500ms
- **UI Responsiveness**: Excellent
- **Error Rate**: 3 errors found (10% of features)

---

## RECOMMENDATIONS

### Immediate Actions Required:
1. **Fix Create Team Dialog** - Likely a React hydration issue
2. **Fix Permissions Runtime Error** - Check RBAC schema initialization
3. **Implement Settings API** - Add PUT endpoints for profile/organization

### Before Production:
1. Add error boundaries for better error handling
2. Implement loading states for all async operations
3. Add validation for all forms
4. Complete API endpoint implementation

### Future Enhancements:
1. Implement file upload system
2. Add bulk operations
3. Build export functionality
4. Enhance search with AI
