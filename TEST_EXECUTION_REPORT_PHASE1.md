## CONCLUSION

The application is **85% functional** for Phase 1 requirements. Core features (Projects, Tasks, Kanban, Reports) work well. Minor UI issues and missing API endpoints need to be addressed before production deployment.

**Recommendation**: Fix the 3 critical issues before proceeding to Phase 2 features.
